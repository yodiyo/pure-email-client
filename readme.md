# Welcome to the test

Create a SPA that:

* Displays list of emails - check
* Allows the user to see a preview of each email - check
* The user should be able to toggle the HTML and plain versions - check
* HTML version is rendered correctly with styles - check
* Plain version is rendered raw with line breaks preserved - check
* Has unit tests - still to do

Bonus points:

* Some styles applied using modern tooling (e.g. a pre-processor) - check
* An end to end test - still to do
* Use of a router - check
* Webpack/Parcel - used Grunt - still on Webpack learning curve
* Production mode - check

## Make it work
* `npm start` - this will install all dependencies in package.json and build the app in development mode, start a server and open the page in the browser
* `npm run build-live` - this will build the app in live mode
