# Welcome to the test

Create a SPA that:

* [x] Displays list of emails
* [x] Allows the user to see a preview of each email
* [x] The user should be able to toggle the HTML and plain versions
* [x] HTML version is rendered correctly with styles
* [x] Plain version is rendered raw with line breaks preserved
* [ ] Has unit tests - installed but not configured - see branch - https://github.com/yodiyo/pure-email-client/pull/4

Bonus points:

* [x] Some styles applied using modern tooling (e.g. a pre-processor)
* [ ] An end to end test - still to do
* [x] Use of a router - check
* [ ] Webpack/Parcel - used Grunt - working on it but the Webpack learning curve is steep!
* [x] Production mode - check

## Make it work
* `npm start` - this will install all dependencies in package.json and build the app in development mode, start a server and open the page in the browser
* `npm run build-live` - this will build the app in live mode
